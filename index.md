# Welcome

Hi,
I'm Alexandr Savca, or chinarulez\* as some users know me.

The main purpose of this page is to get in some place everything (most) I'm involved in (or participated).

### Wireshark

My [contributions to Wireshark](https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/commits?author=chinarulezzz) (network protocol analyzer).

*NOTE: Improve support of ORACLE protocols*

### Wxp78key

[Tiny keylogger](https://github.com/chinarulezzz/wxp78key) for Windows XP/Vista/7/8 with FTP upload.

It was written for educational purposes.

### SMS .pl

[SMS sender](https://github.com/chinarulezzz/sms) (not flooder) for [Moldcell](http://www.moldcell.md/) and [Orange](https://www.orange.md/), my national mobile operators.  It breaks theirs captcha's on the WEB portals, and send SMS (via [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/)).

Also written for educational purposes :)

*NOTE: AFAIK, at now Orange uses javascript scripts to generate user content. That breaks current captcha cracking.  I have no time and desire to add support of the javascript engine :)*
